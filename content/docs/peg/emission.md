Hyperstable seperates `PEG` emissions into two phases:

## Phase 1: Liftoff

At launch, weekly emissions are set at 0.2% of the circulating supply.
Adjustments will be made per epoch if necessary.

## Phase 2: Cruise

After 20 epochs the system will enter "cruise mode" and the emissions will be set at a % of circulating supply based on data from the "Liftoff" phase.
