Liquidity providers (LP's) earn `PEG` tokens by providing liquidity in selected pools. `PEG` emissions are distributed to LP's.

A liquidity pool is a collection of digital assets or tokens that are locked in a smart contract to enable trading. LP's deposit assets into the pool and in return, they receive tokens that represent their ownership of the liquidity.

The tokens that LP's receive after providing liquidity are then to be deposited in a so called Gauge. `PEG` emissions are distributed to gauges based on `vePEG` voting and LP token depositors earn their share of  `PEG` emmisions that flow to the gauge.
