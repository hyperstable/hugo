## Minting bonus
The USH minting bonus is a borrow incentive paid out in `PEG` tokens. This incentive promotes growth of the protocol by allowing borrowers to potentially offset their interest payments. 21% of the initial `PEG` supply will be distributed to USH minters on a weekly basis determined by a preset `PEG` reward-rate (tbd) per USH minted.

## Referral bonus
The referral bonus is a similar incentive model whereby referrers can earn `PEG` tokens based on the USH minted on their referral code. 21% of the initial `PEG` supply will be distributed to referrers on a weekly basis by a preset `PEG` reward-rate.
