A gauge is a smart contract that takes in LP tokens and rewards the depositors with `PEG` tokens and other additional Incentives.

Gauges are a governance mechanism that allow `vePEG` holders to allocate `PEG` Emissions via voting. Gauges make it possible for the community to self-direct the growth of the Hyperstable ecosystem by giving each `vePEG` token holder the power to direct liquidity provision to certain pools.
