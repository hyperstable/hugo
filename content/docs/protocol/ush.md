- USH is a stablecoin, which is a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to be less volatile than other cryptocurrencies because they are pegged to assets that are relatively stable. USH is designed to hold a stable value relative to one US dollar.
- USH is crypto-backed, because it uses cryptocurrencies as collateral. Users can deposit one of the accepted collateral types to create (mint) USH.
- USH is over-collateralized, which means that the backing collateral always needs to have a higher value than the amount of USH in circulation. The purpose of the over-collateralization is to account for volatility.
- USH is decentralised. Collateral types do not have a single point of control, collateral vaults are non-custodial, anyone can mint USH, anyone can trigger a liquidation and interest rates are adjusted onchain by the system.
