# Tokens

Hyperstable uses two tokens to manage its utility and governance:

- `PEG` (ERC-20), is distributed to liquidity providers through emissions
- `vePEG` (ERC-721) which is used for governance, to vote on emissions, to earn (100% of) protocol revenue from interest and liquidation fees and receive incentives. `vePEG` also gets protected from dilution via rebases.  `vePEG` is represented as a (transferrable) NFT.

### Vote Escrow

The "ve" in `vePEG` stands for: vote escrow, which is a mechanism used in decentralized governance to ensure fairness and transparency in decision-making. Any `PEG` holder can vote escrow their tokens and receive `vePEG` in exchange. With Hyperstable, we call this locking.
