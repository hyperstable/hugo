[{"id":0,"href":"/hugo/docs/protocol/ush/","title":"USH","section":"Protocol","content":" USH is a stablecoin, which is a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to be less volatile than other cryptocurrencies because they are pegged to assets that are relatively stable. USH is designed to hold a stable value relative to one US dollar. USH is crypto-backed, because it uses cryptocurrencies as collateral. Users can deposit one of the accepted collateral types to create (mint) USH. USH is over-collateralized, which means that the backing collateral always needs to have a higher value than the amount of USH in circulation. The purpose of the over-collateralization is to account for volatility. USH is decentralised. Collateral types do not have a single point of control, collateral vaults are non-custodial, anyone can mint USH, anyone can trigger a liquidation and interest rates are adjusted onchain by the system.

The safety buffer tracks a percentage of the total USH debt in the vault, safety buffer \u0026ldquo;overflow\u0026rdquo; gets distributed to vePEG (PEG lockers) in USH.\nIn the rare case where a liquidation is unprofitable for the liquidator who calls it (and the safety buffer has insufficient funds to cover the difference), an alternate liquidation process known as \u0026ldquo;redistribution\u0026rdquo; comes into play.\nIn this -edge case- scenario, the system makes the liquidator whole by drawing the required amount of collateral from the vault and redistributes the losses between all debtors in the system relative to their share of the collateral in the vault.\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/hugo/docs/protocol/health_factor/","title":"Health factor","section":"Protocol","content":"A health factor measures the value of collateral in relation to the amount of a loan. A higher health factor indicates a lower risk for the borrower. A loan with more collateral than the value of the loan is considered over-collateralized, which reduces the risk of liquidation.\nThe health factor is calculated by dividing the value of the collateral by the amount of the loan. For example: a loan with a collateral value of $150 coupled with a debt of $100, produces a health factor of 1.5.\nFor users who are unfamiliar with health factors, but familiar with the term loan-to-value: a health factor of 1.5 is the same as a loan-to-value of 0.67.\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/hugo/docs/protocol/collateral_types/","title":"Collateral types","section":"Protocol","content":"Hyperstable supports the following assets as collateral:\nName Contract address HYPE 0x84f108D074f0F9513421d05632D4291cEa8cdd0b wstHYPE 0xC55fAB3DDcab42B6DD2358FBDc59950F832f67Fc uBTC 0x6714cD43536E7E242923aCE3d301a3311DBca6BB uETH 0xE7CEAcCAa613d8fde4e214d7F71c85933cD1F531 "}]
