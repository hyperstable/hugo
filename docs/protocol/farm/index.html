A liquidity pool is a collection of digital assets or tokens that are locked in a smart contract to enable trading. LP&rsquo;s deposit assets into the pool and in return, they receive tokens that represent their ownership of the liquidity.
The tokens that LP&rsquo;s receive after providing liquidity are then to be deposited in a so called Gauge. PEG emissions are distributed to gauges based on vePEG voting and LP token depositors earn their share of  PEG emmisions that flow to the gauge." />

USH is designed to hold a stable value relative to one US dollar. USH is crypto-backed, because it uses cryptocurrencies as collateral. Users can deposit one of the accepted collateral types to create (mint) USH. USH is over-collateralized, which means that the backing collateral always needs to have a higher value than the amount of USH in circulation. The purpose of the over-collateralization is to account for volatility. USH is decentralised. Collateral types do not have a single point of control, collateral vaults are non-custodial, anyone can mint USH, anyone can trigger a liquidation and interest rates are adjusted onchain by the system.
